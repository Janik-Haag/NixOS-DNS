# Modules

There is a module for NixOS and a module for extraConfig.
They both take the same record values and have the same assertions.
Please take a look at the coming pages for a list of available options.
I currently have trouble rendering the record fields if their type is a sub module,
if you are interested in any like caa or mx, you'll sadly have to take a look at [the source](https://github.com/Janik-Haag/NixOS-DNS/tree/main/modules/records.nix) for now.
