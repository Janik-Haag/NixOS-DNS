# Utils

These are a ton of helper functions that are used in NixOS-DNS internally, but you can also use them when working with dns in nix.
Please take a look at the upcoming pages in this chapter for more information.
Sadly no usage examples since I had trouble getting them to render properly with nixdoc and mdBook.
