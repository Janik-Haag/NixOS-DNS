# Introduction

This is the documentation for NixOS-DNS which was built to decouple modules even more from NixOS hosts and is slowly escalating into anything nix\*-dns.
Please open a issue if you find something is missing.

Here you will find:

- automagically generated docs for the modules and utility functions (Work In Progress)
- general usage instructions
- a contributing/development guide
- debugging help
